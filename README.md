**Todolist App**

**Description:**

The Todolist App is a simple web application that allows users to create, manage, and organize their daily tasks. It provides an intuitive interface to add new tasks, mark them as completed, edit task descriptions, and delete tasks when they are no longer needed. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making it easy to use and accessible across different devices.

**Features:**

1. **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks by typing the task description in the input field and clicking the "Add Task" button.

2. **Edit Task**: Each task in the list has an "Edit" button. Clicking on it enables users to edit the description of the corresponding task.

3. **Delete Task**: The "Delete" button associated with each task allows users to remove the task from the list.

4. **Horizontal Scroll for Long Messages**: If a task description is too long to fit in the available space, the task content will be horizontally scrollable to ensure all text is visible.

5. **Persistent Storage**: The app uses local storage to store tasks, ensuring that tasks persist even after the page is refreshed or closed.

6. **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices, providing a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Hidden Features:**

1. **Long Press to Edit**: For touch-enabled devices, long-pressing a task will trigger the edit mode for that task, allowing users to quickly edit the description without clicking the "Edit" button.

2. **Drag and Drop**: Users can drag and drop tasks to reorder them according to their priority or preference. The reordered tasks will be automatically saved using local storage.

**Compatibility:**

The Todolist App is compatible with modern web browsers, including but not limited to Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari, and others.
